# Photography

I take most of my photos on 35mm film.

I use the following cameras, in no particular order:
- Minolta X-700
- Minolta XD-5
- Pentax ME-F
- Polaroid OneStep CloseUp
- Instax Mini 11

I also have the following camera bodies with various issues:
- Minolta XD-5 (Uncalibrated focus crystal)
- Olympus OM-1 (No power)
- Olympus PEN-EE (Unreliable meter)
- Polaroid Spectra System First Edition (Film discontinued)

If you or someone you know is able to repair any of these cameras, please
reach out to me.

I generally get my film developed at a lab, to mitigate the risk of damaging
my film. I'm working toward developing myself, but it's not my main focus. The
film you see on this site was scanned by various labs, including 
[PHTSDR](https://phtsdr.com),
[Photodom.](https://photodom.nyc/),
[The Darkroom](https://thedarkroom.com/),
and [Pro Image Photo](https://proimagephoto.com/).
